Copy By Value : 
                In Copy by value the data which variable hold is passed to another variable .
                Both the variables refers two different memory locations.

                example: var a= 10
                     var b= a
                     console.log(a,b) //ans 10 10
                     b=80
                    console.log(a,b) //ans 10 80


Copy by reference :
                For composite data types objects are copied by reference.
                Actual variable and copied variable both refer to same memory location .
                SO change in data of copied variable will lead to change in data of original variable too.

                example: var a= [1,2,3]
                     var b= a
                     console.log(a,b) //ans [1,2,3] [1,2,3]
                     b[2]=80
                    console.log(a,b) //ans [1,2,80] [1,2,80]
